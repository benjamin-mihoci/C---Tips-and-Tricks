# C programming language
## This is a collection of various tips and tricks I've acquired on my C programming journey. There is no logic in the ordering of the tips, because I add them as I encounter them.

### Tip #1
`if (something != 0)` is reduntant, use `if (something)` instead

### Tipe #2
`for (;;)` is basically the same as `while (true)`
